# Semi-Autonomous vehicle with robotic arm

### This project was built as a final thesis project at the Faculty of Mathemathics and Computer Science from the University of Bucharest, Romania.

This paper addresses the topic of semi-autonomous robots that have means of interaction with the surrounding environment and can perform actions without continuous supervision from an operator, who can therefore control the robots solely by giving tasks.

The present work introduces as a proof-of-concept the implementation of a robot prototype with the following capabilities: autonomous navigation to a point set by coordinates, building a map of the environment through which it moves, planning and following a navigation route, detecting objects of interest based on their appearance and handling them using the robotic arm.

To achieve these goals, the project includes a multitude of hardware and software technologies: high-performance single-board computer, depth video camera, LiDAR sensor, robotic arm specially designed for the project, the Robot Operating System meta-system, mapping algorithms, artificial intelligence for object detection, control panel with web interface, as well as mechatronics elements and their control software.
